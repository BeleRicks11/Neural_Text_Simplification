This is the README file of PaCCSS-IT, a corpus of Complex-Simple Aligned Sentences for ITalian, described in the paper "PaCCSS-IT: A Parallel Corpus of Complex-Simple Sentences for Automatic Text Simplification".
It contains ~63,000 pairs of sentences.

Source data: 
the sentences were extracted and automatically aligned from the ItWaC corpus (Baroni et al., 2009), the largest copy-right free corpus of contemporary Italian web texts.

Data Format:
each line represents an alignment containing the following 6 fields separated by a single tab character:
- Sentence_1: the complex sentence of the alignment
- Sentence_2: the simple sentence of the alignment
- Cosine_Similarity: the cosine similarity between the two sentences
- Confidence: the probability of the alignment calculated by the supervised classifier 
- Readability_1: the readability score of Sentence_1 calculated by READ-IT (Dell'Orletta et al., 2011)
- Readability_2: the readability score of Sentence_2 calculated by READ-IT (Dell'Orletta et al., 2011)
- (Readability_1-Readability_2): the difference between Readability_1 and Readability_2
